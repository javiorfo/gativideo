## Installation
- Using Cargo

cargo install gativideo
```

## Details
- This program is a TUI wrapper of `YTS movies (a.k.a. yify)` and [opensubtitles](https://opensubtitles.org) to search and download movies and subtitles. 
- It uses `transmission-rpc` protocol. Transmission daemon must be configured in order to use **gativideo**
    - [Transmission configuration](https://github.com/transmission/transmission/blob/main/docs/Editing-Configuration-Files.md)
    - [Transmission How To](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/TransmissionHowTo)
- This program serves itself from crates [yts-movies](https://github.com/javiorfo/yts-movies) and [opensubs](https://github.com/javiorfo/opensubs)
- Multiple movies at the time can be downloaded. You can close **gativideo** and the downloads still continue.
